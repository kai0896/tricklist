# Tricklist

Simple React Native mobile app that let's you create a list of sub-tasks (Tricks) that can be practiced in Sessions.  
The App let's you select if a task was successfully executed and keeps track of all Tricks and Sessions.

Tricks are sorted in 3 categories:
- My Tricks: Tasks that have been done successfully
- Tricks to Learn: Tasks that have not been done but are being practiced
- Future Tricks: Tasks are not being practiced yet

## Info
This App was created to try out React and for personal use.  
Some features are not finished / not well implemented yet, but the App is useable.  
Tested only under Android and in the browser but layout is not optimized for big screens.

## Usage
Run using expo:
```
expo start
```
